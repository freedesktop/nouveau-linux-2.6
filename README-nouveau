			Out-of-tree build

The out-of-tree build should be easy:

$ cd nouveau
$ make
$ sudo make install

This will build all the related DRM modules. It is impossible to make
them built-in this way. You also need to make sure all the kernel config
dependencies are met. See nouveau/DEPENDS.

If your kernel already provided any of the three modules, make sure only
the new ones are loaded. The default install path for new modules is
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra/.
